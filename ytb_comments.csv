"""Noor E Azal""

Jahaan Bhi Main Dekhun
Andhera Bada Hai
Jahaan Bhi Main Jaaun
Woh Rasta Kada Hai

Hamesha Dilon Ko
Dilon Se Jo Jode
Wahi Ik Mohabbat Ka Rishta Bada Hai

Aye Khuda Jaaun Kahan?
Gumshuda Mera Jahaan

Mere Maula Saath De
Mera Haath Thaam Le

Tera umda Mushkilon Mein Hai Ghira

Noor-e-azal Noor-e Khuda
Dono jahaano ki ziya
Aage toh chal
Yahi sadaa
Roshan kare rasta tera

Maula mann ko noor se bhar de
Maula mann ko noor se bhar de

Meri rooh ko noor se bhar de
Meri raah ko noor se bhar de

Maula mann ko noor se bhar de
Maula mann ko noor se bhar de

Tere noor hi ka jamaal hai
Jo hai kainaat mein har jagah
Tere noor hi ka kamaal hai
Ke chamak uthe meri har dua

Tera noor hi toh Jameel hai
Tera noor hi toh kareem hai
Tera noor hi toh ghafoor hai
Tera noor hi toh raheem hai
Bas tera noor bas tera noor
Tera noor noor noor

Maula mann ko noor se bharde
Maula mann ko noor se bharde

Meri rooh ko noor se bharde
Meri raah ko noor se bharde

Maula mann ko noor se bharde
Maula mann ko noor se bharde

Dhoom tana na na Dhoom tanna na na
Tere na tere na tere na bedara terena
Tere na tere na tere na bedara terena
YA lalai ya lali ya lailai

Dhoom tana na na Dhoom tanna na na

"I won't say that if I am a Muslim or Hindu or Christian, and let you judge. I just want to convey my deep love and respect for Mr. Atif. He is unconditionally my favourite. 

I would like to mention that I believe he is the best Hindi/Urdu young singer of the current century. Yes, there might be others better than him in talent, range or other aspects. But Atif holds a special X factor that makes him unique and kind of perfect performer and singer in an overall way. His voice is unique and so is his beauty while he perform. A sufi in action. His charm can be compared to Mr. Bachhan. He is not the best actor there, but he is the greatest legend and mass favourite. That's all. Thanks!"

"Jab apka bhrosa uss parmatma k prati gahra ho jata hai aur aap spiritual path par chalne lagte ho aise songs mai shanti mahsus karne lagte ho
Tb chahe hindus song ho muslim ho sikh ho ya christian aap har dharam k songs ko feel karne lagte ho koi matter nhi karta apka dharam kya hai
Kyuki parmatma koi particular person nahi hai
Wo to ek energy hai jo pure bhrmand mai mojud hai

"Hi ️️️,;"
"نبی صلی اللہ علیہ وسلم وہ زات جن  پر میرے ماں باپ قربان ۔۔
 نبی صلی اللہ علیہ وسلم نے اپنی پوری زندگی تکلیف اٹھا 
 کر اس امت کو شرک سے دور کرنے کی کوشش کی 
نبی صلی اللہ علیہ وسلم اس دنیا میں اسی لیے تشریف لاے تھے کے اللہ کی بڑائی بیان کرے اور لوگوں کو شرک سے دور کرے ۔
۔۔۔نبی صلی اللہ علیہ وسلم فرمایا کہ میری تعریف میں ایسا مبالغہ نہ کرنا جیسا عیسائیوں نے عسئ علیہ السلام کے بارے میں کیا ۔میں اللہ کا بندہ ہوں مجھے اللہ کا بندہ اور رسول ہی کہنا ۔۔۔(بخاری شریف  حدیث نمبر 1009))
     اور آج کل لوگ نبی صلی اللہ علیہ وسلم سے ہی مانگ رہے ہیں جو کہ نبی صلی اللہ علیہ وسلم کی تعلیمات کے خلاف عمل کرنا  ہے۔۔
مشکل کوشاں, حامی بیکاساں ،مددگار صرف اللہ پاک ہے ۔دعاؤں کا قبول کرنے والا صرف اللہ پاک ہے 
جب قیامت کے دن نبی صلی اللہ علیہ وسلم کو پتا چلے گا کہ انکی امت بھی عیسائیوں کی طرح انہیں دعا کے لئے پکارتی تھی ۔۔۔۔کتنی تکلیف ہوگی میرے پیارے نبی صلی اللہ علیہ وسلم کو ...اور یہی بات علی اور باقی اصحاب کے لئے بہی ہے۔ہمیں انکی اتبع کرنی چاہیے اللہ کے ساتھ شریک نہیں"
