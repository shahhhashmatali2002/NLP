"I won't say that if I am a Muslim or Hindu or Christian, and let you judge. I just want to convey my deep love and respect for Mr. Atif. He is unconditionally my favourite. I would like to mention that I believe he is the best Hindi/Urdu young singer of the current century. Yes, there might be others better than him in talent, range or other aspects. But Atif holds a special X factor that makes him unique and kind of perfect performer and singer in an overall way. His voice is unique and so is his beauty while he perform. A sufi in action. His charm can be compared to Mr. Bachhan. He is not the best actor there, but he is the greatest legend and mass favourite. That's all. Thanks!"
love from india and i wish inshallah someday i may visit Pakistan or maybe settle there
My heart is so heavy.. after listening it 5 to 6 time now i feel my self so lightly i feel that I am fly in the air  ..every word of this kalam ️
